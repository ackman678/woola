woolaâ€“ A friendly beast who builds and serves content for you.

## Installation

Install into a local project directory:  

    npm install https://github.com/ackmanlab/woola.git

Or install globally (may need to sudo)

    npm install -g https://github.com/ackmanlab/woola.git


If npm is not yet installed locally, first see [Installing node, npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

## Usage

If you have project directory (web app/site, personal/lab notebook repo) containing markdown files (e.g. [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) format with .md, .mmd, or .txt file extensions) then simply navigate to your project and run *woola* for a live preview in your browser:  

    cd path/to/myproject/
    woola

Or run *woola -b* to build a static html site based on the markdown and html files in your directory:  

    woola -b


<!-- 
### Note

If no local css is found in the current project directory the app will currently try to automatically access a commonly used bootstrap 3 css from maxcdn. For best usage, a combination of screen and print (pdf) styles is good. 

-->

For optimal usage, add custom css styles for the included pdf export functionality-- try [ackmanlab/libcss](https://github.com/ackmanlab/libcss) for combined screen/print css already configured for use with woola (just clone libcss locally and add a symlink for your current project directory `ln -s path/to/libcss/build ./myproject/css`).
